# RayTracer
I am trying to implement this tutorial - http://blog.three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/ in DirectX 11 and Win32 API.
I would be extremely grateful if somebody tries to help me in this. Thanks.

Note:
1. Use shader model 5.0 or above for the compute shader.
2. Add the following libraries to the linker:
    a. dxgi.lib
    b. d3dcompiler.lib
    c. d3d11.lib
    d. Xinput.lib
